Teslemetry simplifies access to your Tesla products, provides real-time data from your Tesla vehicles, and integrates this into platforms like Homey.

Control your vehicles with climate settings, charging management, security features (lock/unlock, sentry mode), and more. Monitor energy sites with real-time power flow data and operation mode control. Track Wall Connector charging status and power usage. All vehicle data updates in real-time via Fleet Telemetry with no polling required.

To get started, you'll need a Teslemetry account with an active subscription. Login to teslemetry.com/console and ensure your setup. Then install this app on your Homey and add your Tesla products through the pairing wizard using OAuth authentication.

Legacy vehicles that don't support Fleet Telemetry are not supported by this app at this time.
